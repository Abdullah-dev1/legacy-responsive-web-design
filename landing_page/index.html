      <p id="price" class="price text">
        The proposed price range for the X-Tron, starting at around $100,000, is
        suitable for a number of reasons. First, as a luxury and performance
        vehicle, the X-Tron is equipped with advanced technology such as an
        electric motor, autonomous driving capabilities and a fully-connected
        infotainment system which would raise the production cost of the
        vehicle. Additionally, the use of premium materials such as aluminum
        frame and carbon fiber accents in the car's design contribute to the
        high price point. <br />
        Furthermore, the X-Tron's impressive range of over 300 miles on a single
