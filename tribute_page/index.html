          Muhammad Ali Jinnah (25 December 1876-11 September 1948) was a
          barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as
          the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the
          inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of
          Pakistan's first governor-general until his death. He is revered in
          Pakistan as the Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum ("Father
          of the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in
          Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
          Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he
          enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
          politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to
          prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of
          the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah
          advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
          between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah
          had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India
          Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform
          plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
          subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when
          it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as
          political anarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
          subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
          marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim
          state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the
          Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
          During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders
          of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held
          shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims.
          Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a
          power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India
          to be united as a single state following independence, leading all
          parties to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu
          India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish
          the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of
          Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan
          after the two states' independence, personally supervising the
          establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September
          1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the
          United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan.
          Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after
          Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear
          Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah
          remains Pakistan's greatest leader.

        <h2>Family And Childhood</h2>
        <p>
          Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai,and he likely
          was born in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a
          rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi,
          now in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of
          British India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti
          village in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat,
          India). He was of a Gujarati Khoja Nizari Isma'ili Shi’a Muslim
          background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings
          and was considered an ethnic Muhajir because of his Indian bcakground.
          After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had
          converted in later life to the Sunni sect of Islam. His sectarian
          affiliation at the time of his death was disputed in multiple court
          cases. Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background. His father was a
          merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of
          Paneli in the princely state of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his
          mother was also of that village. They had moved to Karachi in 1875,
          having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an
          economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200
          nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay. Jinnah was
          the second child; he had three brothers and three sisters, including
          his younger sister Fatima Jinnah. The parents were native Gujarati
          speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English.
          Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he
          was more fluent in English.Except for Fatima, little is known of his
          siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he
          advanced in his legal and political careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have
          attended the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at
          the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the
          Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High
          School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high
          school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large
          number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were
          circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court,
          listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the
          glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official
          biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving
          boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah
          discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging
          them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket
          instead.

        <h2>background To Independence</h2>
        <p>
          Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the British Raj expected, upon
          independence, to be part of a unitary state encompassing all of
          British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated
          self-government. Despite this, other nationalist proposals were being
          made. In a speech given at Allahabad to a League session in 1930, Sir
          Muhammad Iqbal called for a state for Muslims in British India.
          Choudhary Rahmat Ali published a pamphlet in 1933 advocating a state
          "Pakistan" in the Indus Valley, with other names given to
          Muslim-majority areas elsewhere in India.Jinnah and Iqbal corresponded
          in 1936 and 1937; in subsequent years, Jinnah credited Iqbal as his
          mentor, and used Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his speeches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although many leaders of the Congress sought a strong central
          government for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, including
          Jinnah, were unwilling to accept this without powerful protections for
          their community. Other Muslims supported the Congress, which
          officially advocated a secular state upon independence, though the
          traditionalist wing (including politicians such as Madan Mohan
          Malaviya and Vallabhbhai Patel) believed that an independent India
          should enact laws such as banning the killing of cows and making Hindi
          a national language. The failure of the Congress leadership to disavow
          Hindu communalists worried Congress-supporting Muslims. Nevertheless,
          the Congress enjoyed considerable Muslim support up to about 1937.
          Events which separated the communities included the failed attempt to
          form a coalition government including the Congress and the League in
          the United Provinces following the 1937 election. According to
          historian Ian Talbot, "The provincial Congress governments made no
          effort to understand and respect their Muslim populations' cultural
          and religious sensibilities. The Muslim League's claims that it alone
          could safeguard Muslim interests thus received a major boost.
          Significantly it was only after this period of Congress rule that it
          [the League] took up the demand for a Pakistan state ..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Balraj Puri in his journal article about Jinnah suggests that the
          Muslim League president, after the 1937 vote, turned to the idea of
          partition in "sheer desperation". Historian Akbar S. Ahmed suggests
          that Jinnah abandoned hope of reconciliation with the Congress as he
          "rediscovered his own Islamic roots, his own sense of identity, of
          culture and history, which would come increasingly to the fore in the
          final years of his life". Jinnah also increasingly adopted Muslim
          dress in the late 1930s. In the wake of the 1937 balloting, Jinnah
          demanded that the question of power sharing be settled on an all-India
          basis, and that he, as president of the League, be accepted as the
          sole spokesman for the Muslim community.
